# {repo-name}

## What is this

{One-line description — what technology/concept this KB module covers.}

> **This is a knowledge base module** — code samples, runnable demos, and real-world documentation. Not a library.

## Key paths

- `src/` or `examples/` — runnable code samples
- `docs/` — written documentation, diagrams
- `README.md` — module overview and index

## Rules

- Code must be runnable — no pseudo-code or incomplete samples
- Each example should have a clear "what this demonstrates" header
- Link to official docs where relevant
- Commit style: conventional commits (`docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`)
